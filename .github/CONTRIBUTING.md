# Contributing to 3GODS Indy Tool

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. Please make sure to read the relevant section before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers and smooth out the experience for everyone involved.

We're an open and welcoming community. Please be sure to read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing code and documentation to submitting bug reports and feature requests.

### Reporting Bugs

If you run into an issue with the project:

-   **Search the existing issues** to see if someone has already reported the same problem.
-   If the issue hasn't been addressed, please [open a new one](https://github.com/3gods/3gods-indy-tool/issues/new).
-   Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one:

-   **Open a new issue** to start a discussion.
-   Clearly describe the proposed enhancement and the problem it solves. This allows us to discuss the potential impact and implementation details before any code is written.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to the project? You can start by looking through `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

-   **Good First Issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
-   **Help Wanted** - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

### Pull Request Process

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `develop`.
2.  **Set up your development environment** by following the instructions in the `README.md`.
3.  **Make your changes.** Please follow the coding style and add any relevant tests.
4.  **Ensure all tests pass** before submitting your pull request.
5.  **Submit a pull request** to the `develop` branch of the main repository.
6.  **Include a clear description** of the changes in your pull request and link to any relevant issues.

## Development Setup

This project is containerized using Docker. To get the development environment up and running, please follow the **Installation** steps in the [README.md](README.md) file.

## Coding Standards
